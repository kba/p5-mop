Perl 5.16 and Beyond
by Jesse Vincent
----
// the thing that jumped out at me was
Reducing the
Perl Core
----
// the idea put forth was to move
// things into modules, where they can
// be loaded as needed, but not burden
// the core perl-guts with them
Core ↝ Modules
// I used this neat unicode wavy arrow
// because there is a certain amount of
// handwaving here. Largely because he
// also talks about preserving past
// version semantics and other not so
// simple things.
----
// but to be honest, if we can even get
// 75% of what Jesse wants done, we will
// be is an incredibly exciting place
75%
----
// hell, even if it is only 50%, that
// is still a pretty awesome accomplishment
// and would me a LOT of the future of perl
50%
----
// because, to put it simply, ...
A simpler language
is a more
evolve-able language
----
  Perl was always designed to
  be an evolving language.
                        — Larry Wall
----
// so, before Jesse gave his talks there
// had been some rumbling that he was perhaps
// open to the idea of putting  MOP into Perl
// so I had actually contacted him about this
// and discussed the possibility, which he
// then ended up putting in his talk slides
// and so that began my
Perl 5 MOP
// project, and since I only have 20 min that
// is largely what this talk is about
----
// wtf is a mop?
MOP???
----
// An API for your object system
API
----
// the mechanics of OO
Classes, Methods,
Attributes and
Instances
----
// or, as I am sometimes fond
// of telling people
... an abstraction of a
system of abstractions
that is used to build
abstractions.
----
an abstraction
(the MOP)
----
system of abstractions
(classes, methods, etc.)
----
build abstractions
(your classes)
----
// now, lets stop to take a look
// at what kind of MOPs exist in
// Perl 5 today
Status Quo
----
// very manual mop, which a
// quirky (to say the least) API
*{$pkg . '::foo'} = \&bar;
----
// NOTE: Moose 2.0205 is depended
// on by 1433 modules on CPAN
Moose
----
// which underlies Moose
Class::MOP
----
// older MOP created by David Wheeler
Class::Meta
----
// perl5i kinda has one
// some of the other Moose-a-likes do too
and others
// so this is all well and good, we have
// gotten a LONG way on these tools, the
// core "MOP" has served us well for ~20
// years, allowing things like Class::Accessor
// and other useful modules, Moose has been
// around for 5+ years now, etc etc.
// But what about the next ~20 years? Can
// we still continue build and inovate on this
// same foundation?
----
The Future
(perhaps)
// what follows is a short tour of my
// proposed new object system for Perl 5
// note that we are still in an early stage
// so some syntax may change and once this
// goes to p5p the color of the bikeshed will
// no doubt go through many revisions too.
// But this is a start, and hopefully one
// in the right direction, you be the judge.
----
// NOTE:
// - class keyword
//     - if no superclass, inherits from Object by default
// - has keyword
//     - "instance-lexical" scoping of attributes
//     - build in support for ro, rw and wo accessors
//         - this is actually a metadata expression
//             - which is like annotations (Java), attributes (C//), decorators (Python)
//             - it is executed at compile time and passed to the meta object being created
//             - metadata is available on the class, has and method keywords
//     - setting the default values of attributes
// - method keyword
//     - the attributes are available in methods as lexical variables
//         - the scope of them being carried around in the instance
//     - the destructuring bind in the clear method
    class Point {
        has $x ( is => 'rw' ) = 0;
        has $y ( is => 'rw' ) = 0;

        method clear {
            ($x, $y) = (0, 0);
        }
    }
----
// NOTE:
// - instance creation is pretty straight forward
//    - constructor takes name/value pairs of the attributes
//    - we didn't have to write a &new method, because we inherited from Object
    my $point = Point->new( x => 10, y => 20 );
----
// NOTE:
// - the extends syntax
// - that $self exists inside methods
// - the next::method syntax calling the superclass-method
    class Point3D (extends => Point) {
        has $z ( is => 'rw' ) = 0;

        method clear {
            $self->next::method;
            $z = 0;
        }
    }
----
// NOTE:
// - how clean the += and -= makes things
//     - note there is no reference to $self in this entire class
// - simple signatures on methods
    class BankAccount {
        has $balance ( is => 'ro' ) = 0;

        method deposit ($amount) {
            $balance += $amount
        }

        method withdraw ($amount) {
            die "Account overdrawn"
                if ($balance <= $amount);
            $balance -= $amount;
        }
    }
----
// NOTE:
// - $balance is not accessible in the subclass methods
//     - attributes are completely private
//     - which means we can now use undescore prefixed methods for protected
    class CheckingAccount (extends => BankAccount) {
        has $overdraft_account ( is => 'rw' );

        method withdraw ($amount) {

            my $overdraft_amount = $amount - $self->balance;

            if ( $overdraft_account && $overdraft_amount > 0 ) {
                $overdraft_account->withdraw(
                    $overdraft_amount
                );
                $self->deposit( $overdraft_amount );
            }

            $self->next::method( $amount );
        }
    }
----
// NOTE:
// - spelling errors on slots are compile time errors
//    - similar to inside-out objects, but less cumbersome
    class Foo {
        has $bar;

        method bar { $baz }; # COMPILE TIME ERROR!
    }
----
// NOTE:
// - packages can contain classes
//     - because classes are first class citizens just like subs, etc.
//     - this is much like other langauges (Java, etc)
// - classes don't need strict and warnings
//     - it would be on by default
    package Foo;

    use strict;
    use warnings;

    class Bar {
        has $baz;
        method foo { $baz }
    }
----
// NOTE:
// - and they are called just as you would expect
    my $foobar = Foo::Bar->new( baz => 'gorch' );
----
// NOTE:
// - the class has access to the package scope as well
//     - this means you can have private subs that are not part of the class namespace
//     - this means you can have static class scoped data as well
//     - the possibilities here are pretty vast ...
    package Bar;

    our $FOO = 100_000;
    sub do_something { ... }

    class Baz {
        has $gorch = 10;
        method foo {
            do_something( $gorch, $FOO )
        }
    }
----
// NOTE:
// - import functions into your package,
//     - then use them in your class
//     - this removes the need to import anything into your class namespace.
//     - no more namespace::clean hacks
// - this also shows BUILD
//     - works just like Moose does
    package DB::FlatFile;

    use Path::Class qw[ file ]

    class DataFile {
        has $path;
        has $file;
        has $data ( is => 'ro' );

        BUILD {
            $file = file( $path );
            $data = [ $file->slurp( chomp => 1 ) ];
        }
    }
----
// all of this actually exists too
http://github.com/stevan/p5-mop/
// there is a prototype even which
// tests the behavior of all of these
// examples
