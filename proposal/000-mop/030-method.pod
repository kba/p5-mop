=head1 NAME

Perl 5 MOP - Meta Object Protocol - Method Sub Protocol

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document will describe the proposed API for the
method sub-protocol of the MOP.

Currently the method sub-protocol is very small, but
it will almost certainly be expanded upon with methods
to introspect the signature and such.

=head2 API

The method sub-protocol is (at this stage) completely
immutable. The reason being that we believe it is
dangerous to allow the manipulation of method internals
simply for the huge potential impact that could have.
Instead you are encouraged to simply clone a method
and change the values during the clone process.

B<AUTHORS NOTE:> This is by no means a comprehensive
list, nor is it a fixed list, of methods. This is simply
the first draft of this, and a rough one at that.

=head3 General

=over 4

=item C<get_name>

This returns the name of this particular method as a string.

=item C<get_body>

This returns the body of this method as a CODE reference,
which can be called using the normal CODE ref syntax.

=item C<execute( $invocant, @args )>

Given an C<$invocant> and an optional array of arguments,
this will execute the method within the scope of the
C<$invocant>.

=item C<clone( %params )>

Clone this object and override any internal elements using
the values in C<%params>.
